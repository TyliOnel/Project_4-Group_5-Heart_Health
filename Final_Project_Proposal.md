# Final Project Proposal
 
## Project Overview
Our project aims to address the issue of coronary heart disease risk prediction by leveraging machine learning techniques. We will utilize the technologies we have learned, including Scikit-learn and possibly other machine learning libraries, to build a predictive model. The project will be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records and will incorporate several key technologies, including Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, JavaScript Plotly, and potentially a SQL or MongoDB database.
 
## Field: Healthcare
 
### Objective
To predict the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on various health and demographic factors.
 
### Key Questions to Answer
1. What are the key factors contributing to heart disease risk?
2. How accurately can we predict heart disease risk using machine learning models?
 
### Data Source
We will use the Kaggle dataset on heart disease for this project.

### Goal
Our goal is to create an interactive website that healthcare professionals can use to input different demographic factors and utilize our model to predict a clientâ€™s risk for CHD.
 
### Target Variable
The target variable we aim to predict is CHDRisk (Coronary Heart Disease Risk).

	- Experiment with more complex models like Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost if needed.
 
3. **Evaluate the Model**:
	- Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model.
 
### Step 4: Model Training, Validation, and Testing
1. **Train Models**:
	- Train different models and tune hyperparameters.
 
2. **Validate Models**:
	- Validate model performance using cross-validation.
 
3. **Test Models**:
	- Test the final model on the testing dataset.
 
### Step 5: Model Evaluation and Visualization
1. **Evaluate Performance**:
	- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
 
2. **Visualization**:
	- Use Matplotlib or Plotly to create visualizations that highlight the findings from your analysis and the performance of your model.
 
### Step 6: Implementation and Deployment
